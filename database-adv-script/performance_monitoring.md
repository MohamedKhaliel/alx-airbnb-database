# Database Performance Monitoring and Optimization

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing schema adjustments. The monitoring focuses on frequently used queries in the Airbnb booking system.

## 1. Performance Monitoring Setup

### 1.1 Enable Performance Monitoring Features

```sql
-- Enable query profiling for detailed performance analysis
SET profiling = 1;
SET profiling_history_size = 100;

-- Enable slow query log for identifying problematic queries
SET long_query_time = 2.0;
SET log_slow_queries = 1;

-- Enable performance schema for detailed monitoring
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments 
SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES' 
WHERE NAME LIKE '%statement/%';

UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers 
SET ENABLED = 'YES' 
WHERE NAME LIKE '%events_statements_%';
```

### 1.2 Create Performance Monitoring Views

```sql
-- Create view for frequently used queries performance
CREATE VIEW v_query_performance AS
SELECT 
    QUERY_ID,
    DURATION,
    CPU_USER,
    CPU_SYSTEM,
    CONTEXT_SWITCHES,
    PAGE_FAULTS,
    SWAPS,
    SOURCE_FUNC,
    SOURCE_FILE,
    SOURCE_LINE
FROM performance_schema.events_statements_history_long
WHERE SQL_TEXT IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY DURATION DESC;

-- Create view for slow queries analysis
CREATE VIEW v_slow_queries AS
SELECT 
    start_time,
    query_time,
    lock_time,
    rows_sent,
    rows_examined,
    sql_text
FROM mysql.slow_log
WHERE start_time >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
ORDER BY query_time DESC;
```

## 2. Critical Query Performance Analysis

### 2.1 Booking Retrieval Query Analysis

```sql

ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### 2.3 Property Search Query Analysis

```sql
-- Query 3: Property search with location and price filtering
-- This query is used for property discovery

-- Execute the query
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.p_name,

HAVING avg_rating >= 4.0 OR avg_rating IS NULL
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, total_bookings DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

## 3. Bottleneck Identification and Analysis

### 3.1 Current Index Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze current index usage and effectiveness
SELECT 
    TABLE_NAME,
    INDEX_NAME,
    COLUMN_NAME,
    CARDINALITY,
    SUB_PART,
    PACKED,
    NULLABLE,
    INDEX_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'alx_airbnb'
ORDER BY TABLE_NAME, INDEX_NAME, SEQ_IN_INDEX;

-- Check index usage statistics
SELECT 
    OBJECT_SCHEMA,
    OBJECT_NAME,
    INDEX_NAME,
    COUNT_FETCH,
    COUNT_INSERT,
    COUNT_UPDATE,
    COUNT_DELETE
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE OBJECT_SCHEMA = 'alx_airbnb'
ORDER BY COUNT_FETCH DESC;
```

### 3.2 Table Statistics Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze table sizes and row counts
SELECT 
    TABLE_NAME,
    TABLE_ROWS,
    ROUND(DATA_LENGTH/1024/1024, 2) AS 'Data Size (MB)',
    ROUND(INDEX_LENGTH/1024/1024, 2) AS 'Index Size (MB)',
    ROUND((DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH)/1024/1024, 2) AS 'Total Size (MB)',
    ROUND(INDEX_LENGTH/DATA_LENGTH * 100, 2) AS 'Index/Data Ratio (%)'
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'alx_airbnb'
ORDER BY TABLE_ROWS DESC;

-- Check for table fragmentation
SELECT 
    TABLE_NAME,
    DATA_FREE,
    ROUND(DATA_FREE/(DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) * 100, 2) AS 'Fragmentation (%)'
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'alx_airbnb' 
    AND DATA_FREE > 0
ORDER BY DATA_FREE DESC;
```

## 4. Performance Improvements Implementation

### 4.1 Identified Bottlenecks and Solutions

#### **Bottleneck 1: Missing Composite Indexes**
**Problem**: Queries with multiple WHERE conditions not using optimal indexes
**Solution**: Create composite indexes for common query patterns

```sql
-- Create composite indexes for better query performance

-- Index for booking status and date range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status_date_range ON Booking(status, start_date, end_date);

-- Index for user search queries
CREATE INDEX idx_user_role_created_name ON User(user_role, created_at, first_name, last_name);

-- Index for property search queries
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location_price_host ON Property(location, price_per_night, host_id, created_at);

-- Index for review aggregation queries
CREATE INDEX idx_review_property_rating ON Review(property_id, rating);

-- Index for payment analysis queries
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_method ON Payment(booking_id, payment_method, amount);
```

#### **Bottleneck 2: Inefficient JOIN Operations**
**Problem**: Large table joins without proper indexing
**Solution**: Optimize join strategies and add covering indexes

```sql
-- Create covering indexes for frequently joined columns

-- Covering index for User table in booking queries
CREATE INDEX idx_user_covering ON User(user_id, first_name, last_name, email, user_role, created_at);

-- Covering index for Property table in booking queries
CREATE INDEX idx_property_covering ON Property(property_id, p_name, location, price_per_night, host_id, created_at);

-- Covering index for Booking table in complex queries
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_covering ON Booking(booking_id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status, created_at);
```

#### **Bottleneck 3: Suboptimal ORDER BY Operations**
**Problem**: Sorting on non-indexed columns causing filesort operations
**Solution**: Create indexes that support common sorting patterns

```sql
-- Indexes for common sorting patterns

-- Index for booking queries sorted by creation date
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_created_desc ON Booking(created_at DESC, booking_id);

-- Index for user queries sorted by total spent
CREATE INDEX idx_user_total_spent ON User(user_id, user_role, created_at);

-- Index for property queries sorted by rating and bookings
CREATE INDEX idx_property_rating_bookings ON Property(property_id, host_id, created_at);
```

### 4.2 Schema Optimizations

#### **Optimization 1: Denormalization for Reporting**
**Problem**: Complex aggregations requiring multiple joins
**Solution**: Create summary tables for frequently accessed aggregated data

```sql
-- Create summary table for user statistics
CREATE TABLE User_Stats (
    user_id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    total_bookings INT DEFAULT 0,
    total_spent DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    properties_owned INT DEFAULT 0,
    avg_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    last_booking_date DATE,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES User(user_id)
);

-- Create summary table for property statistics
CREATE TABLE Property_Stats (
    property_id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    total_bookings INT DEFAULT 0,
    total_revenue DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    avg_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    review_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    last_booking_date DATE,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (property_id) REFERENCES Property(property_id)
);

-- Create indexes on summary tables
CREATE INDEX idx_user_stats_bookings ON User_Stats(total_bookings DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_stats_spent ON User_Stats(total_spent DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_stats_rating ON Property_Stats(avg_rating DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_stats_revenue ON Property_Stats(total_revenue DESC);
```

#### **Optimization 2: Partitioning for Large Tables**
**Problem**: Large Booking table causing slow queries
**Solution**: Implement table partitioning (already implemented in partitioning.sql)

### 4.3 Query Optimization

#### **Optimization 1: Rewrite Complex Queries**
**Problem**: Suboptimal query structure
**Solution**: Optimize query structure and use hints

```sql
-- Optimized booking retrieval query
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    b.created_at as booking_created_at,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.user_role,
    p.property_id,
    p.p_name,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    h.first_name as host_first_name,
    h.last_name as host_last_name,
    h.email as host_email,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_method
FROM Booking b
FORCE INDEX (idx_booking_status_date_range)
INNER JOIN User u FORCE INDEX (idx_user_covering) ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN Property p FORCE INDEX (idx_property_covering) ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN User h FORCE INDEX (idx_user_covering) ON p.host_id = h.user_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay FORCE INDEX (idx_payment_booking_method) ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.status = 'confirmed' 
    AND b.start_date >= '2024-01-01' 
    AND b.end_date <= '2024-12-31'
    AND b.total_price > 100.00
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

#### **Optimization 2: Use Summary Tables for Aggregations**
**Problem**: Expensive aggregations on large datasets
**Solution**: Use pre-computed summary tables

```sql
-- Query using summary tables for better performance
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.user_role,
    u.created_at,
    COALESCE(us.total_bookings, 0) as total_bookings,
    COALESCE(us.total_spent, 0.00) as total_spent,
    COALESCE(us.properties_owned, 0) as properties_owned
FROM User u
LEFT JOIN User_Stats us ON u.user_id = us.user_id
WHERE u.user_role IN ('guest', 'host')
    AND u.created_at >= '2023-01-01'
    AND (u.first_name LIKE '%John%' OR u.last_name LIKE '%Smith%')
    AND (us.total_bookings > 0 OR us.properties_owned > 0)
ORDER BY us.total_spent DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
